We based our editor on floating elements instead of standard static items, this allows for items to be drag and dropped, moved, resized and stacked. 



= Is It Free? =

It is free to build blog entries. We are also producing a more advanced editor that will not be free of charge.

your template doesn't load correctly please email a request that we support  
your template and we will try to program a solution.

Suggestions of features: Email contact@plugnedit.com


* Screen support for pages 1028 px (Larger Margins)
* Screen Support for pages 380 px (Mini Margins)

* Some features have not been turned on for the plugin due
to the lack of understand of most web users.

* PlugNedit can do Angles and we are working on SVG items,
also plugnedit provides html raw code (Great For Emails). 
Html can also be added to the Embed Video button
however it is sometimes tricky to use so we have not 
displayed this as a possible option (Give it a try if you wish).


* PlugNedit can also build pages out side the WordPress Themes
but we are not sure if we should offer this from the WordPress 
Plugin Site.

* If you are interested in some of these advanced features let us know. contact@plugnedit.com
