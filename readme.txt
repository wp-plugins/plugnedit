== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does PlugNedit Work With Themes? =

All Themes tested so far have worked with 
plugNedit.

= Compatibility? =

Plug N Edit does not change much on your site, our editor 
is located separate from your WordPress application. That means you can have other 
editors, plugins and themes installed without conflicts. 

= Another Editor? =

Plug N Edit is a different choice editor with many features, when you want something special, plugnedit provides many tools that are able to create unique blog entries other editors 
do not.


= What is different about Plug N Edit? =

We based our editor on floating elements instead of standard static items, this allows for items to be drag and dropped, moved, resized and stacked. 



= Loading A Template Theme In Background? =
 
We currently load template themes from the 404 not found page of wordpress, if 
your template doesn't load correctly please request that the author of the Theme
update this page.

* Other Features

* Some features have not been turned on for the plugin due
to the lack of understand of most web users.

* PlugNedit can do Angles and we are working on SVG Items,
also plugnedit provides html raw code (Great For Emails). 
Html can also be added to the Embed video button
however it is sometimes tricky to use so we have not 
displayed this as a possible option (Give it a try if you wish).


* PlugNedit can also build pages out side the WordPress Themes
but we are not sure if we should offer this from the WordPress 
Plugin Site.
