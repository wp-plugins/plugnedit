<strong>What type of pages can be built? </strong>

You can build Adaptive, Responsive Flux and Fixed layout pages with the visual editor.


<strong>What Is Responsive Flux Design? </strong>

Responsive Flux design does not push elements down the screen, instead it adapts to the screen and resizes the content, this allows for your page design to look the same on all screens.


<strong>What Is Adaptive Design VS Responsive Design? </strong>

Adaptive pages will look like the page you create in the editor, you are able to create separate pages for mobile and desktop viewers and then your server displays the proper page to the viewers device. Responsive pages push down and squeeze the page on mobile devices.
