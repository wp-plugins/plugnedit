= Is This Plugin Right For My Needs? =

This plugin is useful for anyone that has a wordpress site, it is basically just a easy to use drag and drop visual editor with more options.

= What do I really need to know to make good use of the program? =

The WYSIWYG editor is based on movable objects (Layers), Therefore you should give each object a Name that is easy to remember this will help you make use of all the options of the editor.

= Is It Hard To Install And Use? =

NO, it's plain and simply easy to install, nothing to configure or figure out.

= I already have a plugin for the editor Installed, can I still use Plug N Edit? =

Yes! Plug N Edit works independent of your wordpress editor and will not conflict with plugins you have installed.

= Why Use Plug N Edit? =

We based our web software on a Desktop Publishing design
not html editor. What better type of editor could there be for 
WordPress.

= What is different from other editor plugins? =

First of all Plug N Edit is a completely different editor and is not actually a editor plugin. It is based on a drag and drop design which allows for items to be moved, sized stacked and styled with a click of the mouse.

= Does Plug N Edit Work With Themes? =

All Themes tested so far have worked with Plug N Edit.

= Compatibility? =

Plug N Edit is very compatible with other plugins. Plug N Edit does not change much in your WordPress site, our editor is located separate from your WordPress application. That means you can have other editors, plugins and themes installed without conflicts. 

= Another Editor? =

Plug N Edit is a different choice editor with many features, when you want something special, plugnedit provides many tools that are able to create unique blog entries.


= What is different about Plug N Edit? =

We based our WYSIWYG editor on floating elements instead of standard static items, this allows for items to be drag and dropped, moved, resized and stacked. 


= Is It Free? =

It is free to build blog entries. We are also producing a more advanced editor that will not be free of charge.

= Auto Saves? =

When loading the editor you will be asked if you wish to auto save. We take a snap shot of your page and store 120 minutes of your last edits when turned on.


= Loading A Template Theme In Background? =
 
We currently load template themes from your front page, if 
your template doesn't load correctly please email a request that we support  
your template and we will try to program a solution.

= Importing Links To Media? =

We import links to your pictures, we do not download or store your pictures,
this allows you to use pictures when editing your blog.

= Privacy? =

Plugnedit stores your web address when you visit, we do not collect
names address or emails phone, etc. We only store your blog address as your session to our site.


= I need help with this ? =

Plugnedit provides how to videos in the main menu, if you need specific help email Contact@plugnedit.com and we will assist you in operation of the program.

Suggestions of features: Email contact@plugnedit.com


* Some WYSIWYG features have not been turned on for the plugin due
to the lack of understand of most web users.

* PlugNedit can do Angles and we are working on SVG items,
also plugnedit provides html raw code (Great For Emails). 
Html can also be added to the Embed Video button
however it is sometimes tricky to use so we have not 
displayed this as a possible option (Give it a try if you wish).


* PlugNedit can edit full WordPress pages that are based on a blank theme.
This allows for full editing of blank pages. If this fits your needs you can
