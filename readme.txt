Yes! Plug N Edit works independent of your wordpress editor and will not conflict with plugins you have installed.

= Why Use Plug N Edit? =

We based our web software on a Desktop Publishing design
not a simple html editor. What better type of editor could there be for 
WordPress.

All Themes tested so far have worked with Plug N Edit.

= Compatibility? =

Plug N Edit is very compatible with other plugins. Plug N Edit does not change much in your WordPress site, our editor is located separate from your WordPress application. That means you can have other editors, plugins and themes installed without conflicts. 

= Another Editor? =

Plug N Edit is a different choice editor with many features, when you want something special, plugnedit provides many tools that are able to create unique blog entries.

your template doesn't load correctly please email a request that we support  
your template and we will try to program a solution.

= Importing Links To Media? =

We import links to your pictures, we do not download or store your pictures,
this allows you to use pictures when editing your blog.

= Privacy? =

Plugnedit stores your web address when you visit, we do not collect
names, address, emails, phone, etc. We only store your blog address as your session to our site and temp file for links & page load.
The page load file is for Video and Flash, some browser will not allow these items to be imported and must be loaded locally.


= I need help with this ? =
