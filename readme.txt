this allows you to use pictures when editing your blog.

names, address, emails, phone, etc. We only store your blog address as your session to our site and temp file for links & page load.
The page load file is for Video and Flash, some browser will not allow these items to be imported and must be loaded locally.

also plugnedit provides html raw code (Great For Emails). 
Html Editor can also be added to the Embed Video button
however it is sometimes tricky to use so we have not
